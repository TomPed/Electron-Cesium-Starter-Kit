# Electron-Cesium-Starter-Kit

### Build Guide
1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:TomPed/Electron-Cesium-Starter-Kit.git`
2. Get programming

### Tips

In the repo you will see a few files and directories:

1. `Cesium-1.19`: This is [Cesium](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium). For each release of Cesium this will be updated.
2. `node_modules`: This contains the `packager` and `prebuilt` version of Electron.
3. `README.md`: This.
4. `index.html`: The main page that will be displayed in Electron.
5. `index.js`: The main `js` for Electron.
6. `package.json`: The main package for Electron with added `start` command; which will run `electron .`.

For help with Electron check out the Electron [repo](https://github.com/atom/electron). Check out a simple Cesium application build on Electron, [here](https://github.com/TomPed/Cesium-Editor), for an example.
